# Network-Desktop-Manager 🛠️

This project is about a "Network Desktop Manager," a Java application 💻 that enables connected computers within a local area network (LAN) to communicate and collaborate more effectively. By utilizing socket programming, the Manager facilitates direct communication between devices, allowing for features 📋 like:
    🎯	Remote Desktop Sharing: View and control another computer's screen for troubleshooting or assistance.
    🎯	File Sharing: Easily transfer files between devices on the network.
    🎯 Centralized Management: Network administrators can monitor 💻 and manage client desktop configurations, ensuring system updates and security.
    🎯	User Interaction: Both administrators and clients can interact with the Manager through a user-friendly graphical interface, making managing the network intuitive and convenient.
